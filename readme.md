My dot files collection
===

I once had my own configs but at some point I switched away to use the pairing setup that my company managed. I've decided it's time to take control of my own tools again and make my lightsaber my own crafted work and not the same blue one that was passed out.

To use this, either dump the contents into your user directory (make sure to back up your own things) or manually symlink all of the files (ln -s dotfiles/.vimrc .vimrc) which is what I do personally. There should soon be a script to do this for you, though.

There are lots of things in here copied from other great minds, my sources are sited at the top of the files.
